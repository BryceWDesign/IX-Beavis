# IX-Beavis üì°  
**A terrestrial harmonic-light decoding system for real-time, multidirectional, temporal photon analysis**  
**Developed by Bryce Wooster**

## üß† Introduction  

**Some systems aren‚Äôt designed to be launched into space.  
They‚Äôre designed to trap time and extract truth from light ‚Äî right here on Earth.**  

**IX-Beavis** is a real-world, terrestrial telescope system built to decode photon data in ways no other system can. By utilizing a 360¬∞ array of micromirrors embedded in a sacred geometry coil structure, this device captures, slows, and analyzes light across multiple harmonic layers and timelines ‚Äî without requiring satellite deployment or orbital placement.  

Originally developed in defiance of institutional rejections, the IX-Beavis system is an open-source optical weapon for truth, science, and sovereign minds. It is not speculative. It is not theoretical. It is 100% buildable using today‚Äôs real-world hardware.

## üî≠ What It Actually Does  

IX-Beavis isn't just a telescope. It is a:

- **Temporal Photonic Trap**  
  - Freezes light via phased redirection to stretch photon data time
- **360¬∞ Harmonic Capture Lens**  
  - Uses sacred geometry and MEMS micromirror arrays to extract EM signals from all directions
- **Multi-Spectrum Field Decoder**  
  - Captures and resolves photon behavior from UV to THz, including field-echo and interference resonance
- **Tesla-Harmonic Decoder**  
  - Incorporates 3-6-9 structured coil logic to resolve resonance paths and field imprints
- **Photon Memory Extractor**  
  - Reads path history of incoming photons, including lensing, gravitic warping, and phase anomalies

## üåç Top 5 Real-World Applications

| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **1. Deep-Space Recon** | Read harmonic field patterns, EM emissions, and artificial resonance in exoplanet systems |
| **2. Biophotonic Diagnostics** | Analyze light from living organisms to detect aura, EM stress, or cellular field disruption |
| **3. Gravitational Lens Mapping** | Detect black hole warping, time distortion, or field collapse by decoding light curves |
| **4. Temporal Light Forensics** | Reconstruct lightwave journey data from historical photon paths (e.g., supernova signals) |
| **5. Stealth & Field Intrusion Detection** | Detect cloaked vehicles, signal manipulation, or harmonic distortion within a protected perimeter |

## üîß Construction Methodology

The system will be constructed from:

- High-density **MEMS micromirror arrays** (‚â•1,500)
- Field-stabilized **sacred geometry coil housing**
- Layered **graphene metasurfaces** and **cryogenic isolation**
- Tesla-style 3-6-9 frequency-synced harmonic coils
- EMF-isolated internal shell using ZeroCell-style vacuum structuring
- Quantum dot photodiode arrays for multi-spectrum capture
- Software stack for light echo deconstruction, resonance parsing, and volumetric waveform translation

All materials, control logic, and physical construction methods will be provided in this repository file by file, based on verified build paths using available commercial and open-access parts.

## üí• Project Ethos

This system is not for war.  
It is not for governments.  
It is not for sale.

**IX-Beavis** was created because a system like this was **never meant to be in orbit.** It was meant to be in the hands of those who see beyond the veil and refuse to be blinded by it.

And yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs named after *Beavis from Beavis & Butt-Head* ‚Äî because the people who dismissed the technology at DARPA laughed too.

**Now we build.**
