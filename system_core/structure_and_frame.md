## üß± Purpose

This document outlines the real-world structural layout, load-bearing frame, vibration isolation strategy, and modular component mounting systems for the IX-Beavis telescope array. It ensures maximum stability for precision optics, cryogenic isolation, micromirror coherence, and harmonic field null zones.

## üîß Mounting System (Per Subsystem)

| Subsystem | Mount Type | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Mirror Array** | Precision ceramic brackets with phase-locked standoffs | Aligned using optical interferometry jig |
| **Cryogenic Block** | Suspended via thermal-decoupled aluminum arms | Wrapped in MLI + vibration straps |
| **Tesla Coil Ring** | Rigid mounted on titanium L-bracket; vibration isolators on each side | Harmonic interference shielding on adjacent walls |
| **Control Stack (Raspberry Pi / Jetson)** | Velcro-shock dual mount + thermal foil | EMI-shielded housing, independent heat pipe path |
| **Power Modules** | Rear panel with airflow corridor and fanless dissipation fins | EMI-filtered cable exits, grounded plate underlay

## üåÄ Sacred Geometry Alignment

- **Internal mirror dome** built on concentric trinary ring layout:
  - Golden ratio spacing
  - Gankyil-inspired triple-node symmetry
- **Mirror dome plates** angle inward by 15‚Äì22¬∞, forming a **non-linear photon compression field**
- Center well acts as **resonant null zone**, feeding directly into photon trap buffer

## üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Sequence (Simplified)

1. Fabricate base chassis and align mount rails to grounding star node  
2. Secure cryogenic isolation platform and apply all thermally neutral interfaces  
3. Assemble coil ring and ensure harmonic spacing from mirror array housing  
4. Mount micromirror array shells using provided ceramic + optical brackets  
5. Encase entire unit in aluminum housing with EM shielding layers  
6. Route cables through EM shielded trenches, fasten all solid-state modules  
7. Activate phase-tuning and field null sequence (documented in `/system_core/coil_harmonic_layout.md`)
