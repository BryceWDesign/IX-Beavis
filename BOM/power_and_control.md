## üß© Synchronization Backbone

| Component | Specification | Purpose |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **OCXO Time Base (Shared with Signal Path)** | 10 MHz oven-controlled master oscillator | Shared with `/BOM/sensors_and_signal.md` for temporal lock-in |
| **Master Ground Reference Node** | Copper star-ground plate with differential symmetry lines | Prevents harmonic phase drift and ground loop distortions |
| **Multi-Zone Shield Isolation Ring** | Ferrite bead-lined compartments separating analog/digital/coil domains | Essential for Tesla coil EM isolation at high harmonics |

## üìù Integration Notes

- Tesla harmonic control and mirror actuation must be:
  - **Phase-locked to main OCXO time base**
  - **EM-isolated through shielded partitions**
  - Fed through **filtered, regulated DC rails only**
- Every power subsystem must survive a full **field collapse and self-recover**
- Use **solid ground planes**, **line ferrites**, and **multi-layer shielding** between signal and harmonic sections
