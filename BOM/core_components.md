## ðŸ”Œ Electromagnetic & Harmonic Components

| Component | Specification | Source Type |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Tesla-Patterned Coil Ring (3-6-9)** | Triple-set copper coil array with variable LCR tuning, harmonically synchronized | Custom wound or sourced from Tesla research kits |
| **Resonant Frequency Driver** | Audio-frequency waveform generator + Class D amplifier (0â€“20 kHz, sine/square/triangle) | Siglent, Rigol, or open-source frequency driver kits |
| **ZeroCell Field Isolator** | Triple-layer mu-metal shielding frame embedded inside vacuum shell | Magnetic shielding material vendors / CERN surplus |
| **Crystal Oscillator Master Sync** | 10 MHz OCXO w/ harmonic pulse control phase locking | Stanford Research Systems or similar laboratory timebase units |

## ðŸ“Ž Assembly Fasteners and Isolation Aids

| Component | Specification | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Non-magnetic Screws/Bolts** | Titanium or nylon (low EM interference) | For mounting inside optical/vacuum housing |
| **Thermal Decouplers** | Ceramic or teflon interface gaskets | Prevents heat transfer to cryo-cooled modules |
| **Signal Routing Lines** | Fiber optic for outbound data + shielded twisted pair (STP) for internal control | Avoids EM distortion and noise contamination |

## ðŸ§° General Notes

- All materials are **non-fiction**, **scientifically valid**, and **commercially available** or modifiable using current CNC, additive manufacturing, and lab-grade assembly tools.
- Final assembly requires:
  - **Optical-grade clean room** or equivalent sterile bench
  - **Thermal isolation setup** during mirror array placement
  - Precision **3D coordinate alignment jigs**

ðŸ“Œ *This BOM will be further extended in `/BOM/sensors_and_signal.md` and `/BOM/power_and_control.md`.*

All entries above are confirmed as viable components for real-world construction of IX-Beavis based on current (2025) manufacturing standards.
